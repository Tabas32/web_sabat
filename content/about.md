I written my first "Hello world" program back in highschool, and instantly fell in love with programming. For last five years I have been studying informatics.
As time passes, I have realized that computers are getting faster, but software is slower and slower. Even that I have spend years in university, no one have taught me how to write efficient code.
This is the reason why I created this web. I want to explore hidden secrets of proffesional programming.
