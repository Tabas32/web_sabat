## Hello everyone

This is my first blog post ever.
I don't even know what to write or if there will be more of these.
But there is one thing I know it has to be done.
I need to start with most common practice in the world.
And it is "Hello world" program.

Lets write the simplest code there is.
I will use C language, because why not.

Step 1:
Create file "hello.c"

Step 2:
Write following in "hello.c"

	#include<stdio.h>

	int main(){
		printf("Hello world\n");
	}

Step 3:
In terminal write > gcc -o hello hello.c

Stem 4:
Run with > ./hello

Here it is. We did it!  
One more time welcome to this website, I hope you will
find something you like.
