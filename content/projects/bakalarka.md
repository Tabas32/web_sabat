Name of my bachelor thesis is Music Visualizer. I tried to use machine learning techniques to allow computers create pictures out of music. For that it was necessary to create dataset of pictures and songs. 

I have used classical music as it is more emotion driven and doesnt require to understan word (because there are none). As first I created and trained Variational Autoencoder Network do create set of latent variables from music peases. This variables I then used in Generational Adversarial Neural Networks.

Here are some results (from Mozart): \\
