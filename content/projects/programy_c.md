#### Contribution to Godot
One of the most recent thing that I did in C++ was working on open source game engine Godot. I wanted to try open source development. I have found Issue on github page of Godot that I felt confortable with as my first Issue ever. I was little bug in script editor. Godot language is simmilar to python, so imagine it like after "if condition :" there should be indent on new line. Well if there was comment after ":", then on new line was no indentation. As I refused to use some IDE and relied on Vim and Linux termial, searching and reading code base took some time. But at the end I sucesfully repaired this bug. \\

#### Arduino
I don't have extensive knowledge of electrotechnics, so I am limited in what I can create with this piece of technology. But as assignment in my first year of college I created simple Tamagotchi with use only buttons, led and sensors for temperature and light. It was quite fun little project and I learned how microcontrolers work. My little electronic pet had health, energy and hunger. It felted cold and was getting tired when was dark.

#### CopyMaster
Written in C, copy master is clone of linux command cp. At least is trying to be. It have served it purpose, through this assignment I have learned how operating system work and it change how I view files. Not only you could copy files, you could get environment variables, names of all files in specified file (also recursively in its subfiles), append or copy only selected part of file. And more.\\

#### MPI
One processor will only get you so far. But we have multiprocessor systems everywhere. With use of MPI(Message Passing Interface) library, it is relatively simple to create programs that compute parallelly. One of the most common exercise for this is matrix multiplication. I have coded program that perform tensor product of two matrixies on multiple processors.

#### Tic Tac Toe
One of my first programs was game Tic Tac Toe. This implementation of well known game is for linux terminal. Of course you cannot play it alone. So for that reason it was necessary to create option for lan multiplayer game. \\
